T.PallidumSeattle.Rmd is a collection of rscripts for caluculating SNP distances, generating PCR vs Ttime fig 1 and Phylogenetic tree fig 2.

SNP_Dist_molten.tsv and metadata_snp.csv are snp distances for seattle TP, just different formats. The SNP_Dist_molten.tsv is used for all calculations while metadata_snp.csv is remformated is the rmarkdown and used as a supplemental figure.

TP_Seattle.treefile is used to generate the phylogenetic tree; along with metadata.csv to add heatmap graphs

metadata_SumTable.csv is used to generate the summary table for the paper

TP_Recombinant_Regions_Masking.py is used to mask specific recombinant regions in the TP fastas

metadata_snp.csv is used to seperate SS14 and Nichols samples for snp calculations
